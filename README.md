It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times a nebulous unease. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they (using "you" from here on) just locked their keys in the car, or the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

It appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors (when the trigger is specific) or increase vigiliance (when the trigger is something nebulus). For instance, say you're riding in a car with a friend who drives 20mph above the speed limit: this experience likely would induce anxiety. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (anxiety/a feling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car), so that next time your friend offers to drive you avoid accepting in the future, potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brains are equipped with understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like it's much more potent to experience a negative response, just like touching a hot stove is likely something one only does once.
