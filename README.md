It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times a nebulous unease. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they (using "you" from here on) just locked their keys in the car, the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you call a new acquitance by the wrong name and are corrected publicly by a friend.
