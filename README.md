It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times a nebulous unease. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they (using "you" from here on) just locked their keys in the car, or the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

It appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors (when the trigger is specific) or increase vigiliance (when the trigger is something nebulus). For instance, say you find yourself riding in a car with a friend who is driving 20mph over the speed limit: this experience would likely induce anxiety in most. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (a feeling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car). This is clearly evolutionarily advantageous: the next time your friend offers to drive, a rush of anxiety ensues, inducing you to refuse and potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brain is capable of understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like a may more effective way of controlling behavior may be to associate the stimulus with a negative response. A strong cerebral understanding appears powerless against emotion. For instance: understanding the exceedingly low probability of falling through a glass floor of a tall building does nothing to assuage the anxiety of an acrophobic.
