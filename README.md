# Origins

It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times is simply a nebulous unease with no apparant cause. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they just locked their (using "you" from here on) keys in the car, the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

When the trigger is specific, it appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors. For instance, say you find yourself riding in a car with a friend who is driving 20mph over the speed limit: this experience would likely induce anxiety in most. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (a feeling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car) via classical conditioning. This is clearly evolutionarily advantageous: the next time your friend offers to drive, a rush of anxiety ensues, inducing you to refuse and potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brain is capable of understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like it may be more effective, or primal, or both, to control behavior by associating the stimulus with a visceral feeling. Intuitively, a strong cerebral understanding appears powerless against emotion. For instance: understanding the exceedingly low probability of falling through a glass floor of a tall building does nothing to assuage the anxiety of an acrophobic standing on the top floor of the Space Needle. 

Much of the anxiety people experience is episodic and in response to specific events, but when anxiety turns pernicious is when it is sustained and with unidentifiable cause. We'll refer to this as primary (or essential) anxiety<sup>1</sup>. The underlying cause of primary anxiety is likely genetic (some brain chemistry predisposition), learned secondhand (from observing parents/family/friends/partners respond to stimuli), learned firsthand via trauma (PTSD, extreme conditions like starvation), or some combination thereof. 

Those with primary anxiety occassionally are able to harness it to achieve unparalleled productivity, provided their deficiency needs (water, food, shelter, health, security), as described in Maslow's hierarchy<sup>2</sup>, are being met. Primary anxiety appears able to galvanize an individual in most circumstances despite exhaustion, sleep deprevation, hunger, etc. This is understandable, as anxiety is an emotion on which survival often relies in times of hardship (being pursued by a predator, hunting for food during famine). By channeling this anxiety into certain tasks on which survival does not rely, "I'll feel better once I perfect this project", "I'll be able to relax once I finish my homework", an extrodinary reserve of work capacity is unlocked. As this work ethic is often rewarded by society (parental praise, financial gain), the habit of channeling anxiety as a means of productivity is reinforced. Over time, the reinforcement of this habit tends toward completionism and perfectionism, as the brain naturally begins to anticipate that its reward will be proportional to the amount of work and quality of work completed. It's no surprise, then, that perfectionism has been found to have significant associations with primary anxiety<sup>3</sup>. The dangers of this positive feedback loop should be evident. A sustained state of this anxiety can cause ill health effects: among individuals who reported at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime, it was found that 70% had an anxiety disorder<sup>4</sup>.
