# Origins

It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times is simply a nebulous unease with no apparant cause. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they just locked their (using "you" from here on) keys in the car, the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

When the trigger is specific, it appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors. For instance, say you find yourself riding in a car with a friend who is driving 20mph over the speed limit: this experience would likely induce anxiety in most. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (a feeling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car) via classical conditioning. This is clearly evolutionarily advantageous: the next time your friend offers to drive, a rush of anxiety ensues, inducing you to refuse and potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brain is capable of understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like it may be more effective, or primal (or both) to control behavior by associating the stimulus with a visceral feeling. Intuitively, a strong cerebral understanding appears powerless against emotion. For instance: understanding the exceedingly low probability of falling through a glass floor of a tall building does nothing to assuage the anxiety of an acrophobic standing at the top of the Space Needle. 

It wouldn't be unprecedented for organisms to keep around more primal systems (i.e. the gut response) to use as an auxillary/backup system when the evolutionarily newer (i.e. the brain) system isn't sufficient. For example, in the reconstitution of ATP (the simplest form of energy for cells), once phosphocreatine in muscle cells is depleted and when there is insufficient oxygen for oxidative metabolism to take place (for instance, if many muscles are being worked excessively and the circulation isn't able to provide enough oxygen fast enough), anerobic glycolysis begins to reconstitue the ATP. Anerobic glycolysis produces ATP significantly faster (about 100x) than aerobic respiration, but significantly less efficiently (only 2 ATP are produced per mole of glucose compared with 32 ATP when sufficient oxygen is present) and with the potential byproduct of lactic acid (the cause for the burning sensation in an overworked muscle)<sup>1</sup>. It's believed that anerobic glycolysis is an ancient form of energy production that organisms had before there was sufficient oxygen in the atmosphere for oxidative metabolism to have evolved<sup>1</sup>. As anaerobic respiration is to oxidative metabolism, the gut response could be an evolutionary precursor to the highly complex organ we have for guiding decision making today: the brain. 

Much of the anxiety people experience is episodic and in response to specific events, but when anxiety turns pernicious is when it is sustained and with unidentifiable cause. We'll refer to this as primary (or essential) anxiety<sup>1</sup>. The underlying cause of primary anxiety is likely genetic (some brain chemistry predisposition), learned secondhand (by being instructed how to or observing how  parents/family/friends/partners respond to stimuli), learned firsthand via trauma (PTSD, extreme conditions like starvation, a very demanding job/school, etc.), or some combination thereof. 

# Benefits

Those with primary anxiety occassionally are able to harness it to achieve unparalleled productivity, provided their deficiency needs are being met (water, food, shelter, health, security, as described in Maslow's hierarchy<sup>2</sup>). Primary anxiety appears able to galvanize an individual in most circumstances despite exhaustion, sleep deprevation, hunger, etc. This is understandable, as anxiety is a mental state on which survival often relies in times of hardship (being pursued by a predator, hunting for food during famine). By channeling this anxiety into certain tasks on which survival does not rely, "I'll feel better once I perfect this project", "I'll be able to relax once I finish my homework", an extrodinary reserve of work capacity is unlocked and, if left unchecked, tends toward perfectionism and completionism. Completing as many tasks as possible and to the best of one's ability becomes the way this "artificial" anxiety is dispelled, and since this work ethic is often rewarded by society (parental praise, financial gain), the habit of channeling anxiety as a means of productivity is reinforced. Over time, the reinforcement of this habit tends toward completionism and perfectionism, as the brain begins to anticipate that its reward will be proportional to the amount of work and quality of work completed. It's no surprise, then, that perfectionism has been found to have significant associations with primary anxiety<sup>3</sup>. The dangers of this positive feedback loop should be evident. A sustained state of this anxiety can cause ill health effects: among individuals who reported at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime, it was found that 70% had an anxiety disorder<sup>4</sup>.

# Symptoms and measurement

One can think of primary anxiety as a pre-disorder form of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). That is, before the symptoms of GAD begin to interfere with daily life and it becomes a disorder. Thus, the symptoms of primary anxiety should be lighter versions of GAD's<sup>5</sup>, which are: 
* Persistent worrying about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events
* Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes
* Difficulty handling uncertainty
* Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision
* The inability to set aside or let go of a worry 

When in a state of primary anxiety, one acts as though they can't handle any additional hardship. This results in a fortification of control over one's resources, environment, and life path. A common manifestation of this control is inflexibility and intolerance: those with moderate primary anxiety may attempt to control the actions of others in their life (especially roommates and partners) if they percieve those actions have even a slight negative impact on them. Those with severe primary anxiety may even demand control over the actions of others when said actions do not impact them at all, or they may have panic attacks when there are even small deviations from expectations. 

As an attempt to settle the underlying nebulous unease, primary anxiety screams to the conscious "`x` needs to change for me to go away", where `x` is in constant flux. This results in a perpetual and incredibly uncomfortable state of unrest, during which the anxiety appears to attach itself to every aspect of one's life (e.g. "maybe re-using this disposable water bottle is causing my daily nausea", "maybe the onions I had in last night's dinner are causing my morning gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)", "maybe I just need to finally vaccum the entire apartment", "maybe I just need to drop off that letter at the post office", "maybe it's the unpaid credit card bill that's causing all of this stress"). The state of action (working on a task that's been stuck on your to-do list) or distraction (e.g. chopping tomatoes for your partner's dinner) are the only states where this discomfort is abated. More passive activities, such as watching TV, reading, listening to music, etc. are too regularly interrupted by the mind's eye refocusing itself on that everpresent feeling of unease and the next proposed action that could finally be the fix. By the end of each day, this guessing game and the incessant journeys that follow finally come to an end with the onset of the anxious mind's most enjoyable activity: sleep.

(Purely anecdotal) manifestations/measurements of primary anxiety are as follows: 
* One's ability to speak continuously without a break for thought (eloquence)
* One's comfort with sitting in silence with their thoughts without taking action, speaking, or consuming media (television, music, a podcast, etc.)
* One's typing speed compared to their baseline
* One's ability to decide where to go or what to purchase among multiple options (e.g. which vaccum cleaner to choose, which item to order, which laundromat to go to, which movie to watch)
* One's ability to make sustained eye contact
* One's sensitivity to pain and physical discomfort (hot, cold, dry, wet, etc.)
* One's ability to withhold information in the face of pressure
* One's openness to: 
  *  Sharing resources (food, money, sponges, etc.)
  *  Trying new foods
  *  Dancing
  *  Making jokes
  *  Meeting new people
* One's proclivity to repeatedly check: 
  * That morning alarms are set
  * That doors are locked
  * That medication has been taken
  * That items have not been left behind

# Treatment

Neuroplasticity sits at the core of treatement for primary anxiety, but it's important to recognize that, like many biological systems, changes take effort over time. Thus, while treatment is underway, it's imperative that the patient is made as comfortable as possible and their desires, however unreasonable, are catered to. For instance, say your partner, who is currently suffering from severe primary anxiety, prefers to drink Coke over Pepsi. If you take them out to dinner and the restauraunt only has Pepsi, you don't simply ask them if another drink is acceptable; you should suggest going to a different restauraunt (as unreasonable as that may seem). Even this unexpected event of not having Coke and having to change plans may still be very distressing to your partner, so constant reassurance is needed that they're all right.

One can visualize treatment of primary anxiety (and likely depression, or any other mental state, such as addiction) with the following analogy: imagine a snow covered hill<sup>6</sup> and a sled repeatedly sledding down this hill. As the sled goes down the hill repeatedly, one path in the snow will eventually become predominent, and so the sled will tend toward that existing, ingrained path. As the sled continues down this existing path, it becomes deeper and deeper, and thus increasingly difficult for the sled to not end up taking the path as it heads down the hill. Now imagine that the path the sled takes is a pattern of thought (like the train of thought that's started when one is asked to recall an abusive partner), or a habit (like brushing your teeth every morning), or a reaction when presented with a certain stimulus (like a fear of dogs that was instilled by growing up around ferals). The brain is really just a collection of billions of these hills, each with a sled skidding down its hill at a regular interval (in the same way a CPU advances the state of a computer to perform calculations; it's clock ticking at a regular interval, advancing the flow of electricity from the hard drive, to RAM, to registers on the CPU die). Given no change in outside influence on this system of sleds, as time passes, the existing paths remain the same (in fact, they may become even more ingrained). It takes outside influence (or "work", in the physics definition, which is applying some force over a certain distance, `W = F x d`) in order to cause the sled to deviate from the existing ingrained path. 

One of the worst possible situations is two cohabitants who are both struggling with primary anxiety, as it's likely that their preferences are not fully aligned and since their desires are wholly inflexible, neither is able to accomodate the other (resulting in many fights and impasses). Moreover, the stimuli that induces anxiety in one may start to induce it in the other (i.e. second hand learning), meaning an exarcerbation in both cohabitants' anxiety. The individuals should be isolated from each other and treated separately. Both individuals need treatement, otherwise the treatement of one will likely be undone over time by continuing to live with the other: one must remove the entirety of this mental cancer; removing half of it simply slows its inevitable spread. Anxiety, in this way, should be viewed as a mentally transmitted disease (MTD) that can transmit between any two individuals who spend a lot of time together or cohabitate. This is likely why many psychologists start by examining one's childhood, as it's probable that an untreated MTD would be transmitted from parent to child. 

The anticipation of events also appears to exacerbate the experience of anxiety (in both healthy adults and those with GAD). Studies found that _prior_ to being asked to touch a hot stove<sup>7,</sup><sup>8</sup> or being shown an aversive picture<sup>9</sup>, the amygdala (a region of the brain associated with anxiety) showed anticipatory activity. In fact, in those with GAD, the amygdala was activated preceding being shown both aversive and neutral pictures. Thus, it's likely beneficial to reduce or eliminate planning events with those who are suffering from primary anxiety, as even the anticipitation of an event (whether innocuous or not) is likely to be distressing. To the extent possible, decisions made about events/activities should be allowed to be spur-of-the-moment at the onset of said event/activity, rather than in advance.
