# Origins

It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times is simply a nebulous unease with no apparant cause. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they just locked their (using "you" from here on) keys in the car, the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

When the trigger is specific, it appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors. For instance, say you find yourself riding in a car with a friend who is driving 20mph over the speed limit: this experience would likely induce anxiety in most. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (a feeling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car) via classical conditioning. This is clearly evolutionarily advantageous: the next time your friend offers to drive, a rush of anxiety ensues, inducing you to refuse and potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brain is capable of understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like it may be more effective, or primal (or both) to control behavior by associating the stimulus with a visceral feeling. Intuitively, a strong cerebral understanding appears powerless against emotion. For instance: understanding the exceedingly low probability of falling through a glass floor of a tall building does nothing to assuage the anxiety of an acrophobic standing at the top of the Space Needle. 

Much of the anxiety people experience is episodic and in response to specific events, but when anxiety turns pernicious is when it is sustained and with unidentifiable cause. We'll refer to this as primary (or essential) anxiety<sup>1</sup>. The underlying cause of primary anxiety is likely genetic (some brain chemistry predisposition), learned secondhand (from observing parents/family/friends/partners respond to stimuli), learned firsthand via trauma (PTSD, extreme conditions like starvation, a very demanding job/school, etc.), or some combination thereof. 

# Benefits

Those with primary anxiety occassionally are able to harness it to achieve unparalleled productivity, provided their deficiency needs are being met (water, food, shelter, health, security, as described in Maslow's hierarchy<sup>2</sup>). Primary anxiety appears able to galvanize an individual in most circumstances despite exhaustion, sleep deprevation, hunger, etc. This is understandable, as anxiety is a mental state on which survival often relies in times of hardship (being pursued by a predator, hunting for food during famine). By channeling this anxiety into certain tasks on which survival does not rely, "I'll feel better once I perfect this project", "I'll be able to relax once I finish my homework", an extrodinary reserve of work capacity is unlocked and, if left unchecked, tends toward perfectionism and completionism. The mechanism by which primary anxiety evolves into completionism and perfectionism is rather intuitive: completing all desired tasks and doing so with perfection is a natural way of attempting to stave off further suboptimal outcomes (i.e. avoiding the hardships that induced the anxiety in the first place). As this work ethic is often rewarded by society (parental praise, financial gain), the habit of channeling anxiety as a means of productivity is reinforced. Over time, the reinforcement of this habit tends toward completionism and perfectionism, as the brain begins to anticipate that its reward will be proportional to the amount of work and quality of work completed. It's no surprise, then, that perfectionism has been found to have significant associations with primary anxiety<sup>3</sup>. The dangers of this positive feedback loop should be evident. A sustained state of this anxiety can cause ill health effects: among individuals who reported at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime, it was found that 70% had an anxiety disorder<sup>4</sup>.

# Symptoms and measurement

One can think of primary anxiety as a pre-disorder form of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). That is, before the symptoms of GAD begin to interfere with daily life and it becomes a disorder. Thus, the symptoms of primary anxiety should be lighter versions of GAD's<sup>5</sup>, which are: 
* Persistent worrying about a number of areas that are out of proportion to the impact of the events
* Overthinking plans and solutions to all possible worst-case outcomes
* Difficulty handling uncertainty
* Indecisiveness and fear of making the wrong decision
* The inability to set aside or let go of a worry 

When in a state of primary anxiety, one acts as though they can't handle any additional hardship. This results in a fortification of control over one's resources, environment, and life path. A common manifestation of this control is inflexibility: those with moderate primary anxiety may attempt to control the actions of others in their life (especially roommates and partners) if they percieve those actions have even a slight negative impact on them. Those with severe primary anxiety may even demand control over the actions of others when said actions do not impact them at all, or they may have panic attacks when there are even small deviations from expectations.

(Purely anecdotal) manifestations/measurements of primary anxiety are as follows: 
* One's ability to speak continuously without a break for thought (eloquence)
* One's comfort with sitting in silence with their thoughts without taking action, speaking, or consuming media (television, music, a podcast, etc.)
* One's typing speed compared to their baseline
* One's ability to decide where to go or what to purchase among multiple options (e.g. which vaccum cleaner to choose, which laundromat/restauraunt to go to, which movie to see)
* One's ability to make sustained eye contact
* One's sensitivity to physical pain/discomfort
* One's ability to withhold information in the face of pressure
* One's openness to: 
  *  Sharing resources (food, money, sponges, etc.)
  *  Trying new foods
  *  Dancing
  *  Making jokes
  *  Meeting new people
* One's proclivity to repeatedly check: 
  * That morning alarms are set
  * That doors are locked
  * That medication has been taken
  * That items have not been left behind

# Treatment

Neuroplasticity sits at the core of treatement for primary anxiety, but it's important to recognize that, like many biological systems, changes take effort over time. Thus, while treatment is underway, it's imperative that the patient is made as comfortable as possible and their desires, however unreasonable, are catered to. For instance, say your partner, who is currently suffering from severe primary anxiety, prefers to drink Coke over Pepsi. If you take them out to dinner and the restauraunt only has Pepsi, you don't simply ask them if another drink is acceptable; you should suggest going to a different restauraunt (as unreasonable as that may seem). Even this unexpected event of not having Coke and having to change plans may still be very distressing to your partner, so constant reassurance is needed that they're all right.

One of the worst possible situations is two cohabitants who are both struggling with primary anxiety, as it's likely that their preferences are not fully aligned and since their desires are wholly inflexible, neither is able to accomodate the other (resulting in many fights and impasses). Moreover, the stimuli that induces anxiety in one may start to induce it in the other (i.e. second hand learning), meaning an exarcerbation in both cohabitants' anxiety. The individuals should be isolated from each other and treated separately. Both individuals need treatement, otherwise the treatement of one will likely be undone over time by continuing to live with the other: one must remove the entirety of this mental cancer; removing half of it simply slows its inevitable spread. Anxiety, in this way, should be viewed as a mentally transmitted disease (MTD) that can transmit between any two individuals who spend a lot of time together or cohabitate. This is likely why many psychologists start by examining one's childhood, as it's probable that an untreated MTD would be transmitted from parent to child. 

Anticipation also appears to exacerbate the experience of anxiety (in both healthy adults and those with primary anxiety). Specifically, _prior_ to being asked to touch a hot stove<sup>6,</sup><sup>7</sup> or being shown an aversive picture<sup>8</sup>, the amygdala (a region of the brain associated with anxiety) showed anticipatory activity. In fact, in those with GAD, the amygdala was activated preceding being shown both aversive and neutral pictures. Thus, it's likely beneficial to reduce or eliminate planning events with those who are suffering from primary anxiety, as even the anticipitation of an event (whether innocuous or not) is likely to be distressing. To the extent possible, decisions made should be allowed to be spur-of-the-moment. 

TODO: finish anticipation (possibly) and start on anxiey attaching to various things as a way of trying to fix the cause.
