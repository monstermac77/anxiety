It's important to start with a definition: anxiety is often described as a feeling of unease, sometimes about something specific and other times is simply a nebulous unease with no apparant cause. It could be the rush felt when one realizes they just locked their (using "you" from here on) keys in the car, the churning stomach you feel in the minutes leading up to an important standardized test, or the feeling that comes when you're corrected publicly by a friend after calling a new acquitance by the wrong name. 

It appears as though anxiety almost acts as a positive punishment to discourage certain behaviors (when the trigger is specific). For instance, say you find yourself riding in a car with a friend who is driving 20mph over the speed limit: this experience would likely induce anxiety in most. It's almost as if the anxiety is acting as a protective measure to provide you with a negative response (a feeling of unease) in association with this stimulus (your friend driving the car) via classical conditioning. This is clearly evolutionarily advantageous: the next time your friend offers to drive, a rush of anxiety ensues, inducing you to refuse and potentially avoiding injury or death. While our brain is capable of understanding that speeding 20mph over the speed limit is more likely to induce injury and so we should avoid doing so, it seems like it may be more effective, or perhaps more primal, to control behavior by associating the stimulus with a visceral feeling. Intuitively, a strong cerebral understanding appears powerless against emotion. For instance: understanding the exceedingly low probability of falling through a glass floor of a tall building does nothing to assuage the anxiety of an acrophobic standing in the Space Needle. 

Much of the anxiety people experience is episodic and in response to specific events, but when anxiety turns pernicious is when it is sustained and with unidentifiable cause. The origin of this anxiety is likely genetic (some brain chemistry predisposition), learned secondhand (from observing parents/family/friends/partners respond to stimuli), learned firsthand via trauma (PTSD, extreme conditions like starvation), or some combination thereof. Those with this anxiety of unknown origin appear sometimes to learn how to harness it to achieve incomparable productivity.
